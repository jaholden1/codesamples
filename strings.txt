= Restructuring Strings

== Answers

1. Instead of looping through the whole string to count the numbers of characters, you can access the string length by getting the value at the address of the first character s[0].

2. Someone might be searching for the start of a string and start or stop counting from the middle of another string because there is a number inside the string. The value to designate the end or start of a string should not be synonymous with any other values.

3. 
size_t strlen(const char *s)
{
    int n = s[0];
    return n;
}
