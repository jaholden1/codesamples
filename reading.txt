= Reading Someone Else's Code

== Answers

1. returning anything other than 0 signifies an error. Returning the value of CHAR_MAX signifies an error, and gives an idea of what caused the error using $echo $?. Because the function return type is VOID, you can't return NULL anyways.

2. We try to read two via scanf() because we need to account for the character read when we press 'enter'.

3. When you use a string or allocation as a literal, the value is placed in read-only memory and cannot be modified. Such a declaration would allocate data on the stack. If you didn't designate these vars as static, they would be vulnerable to being changed or memory deallocated.

4. Because get_string() stores string on heap, and the library's destructor (causes teardown to be called automatically after main has completed or exit has been called in a program) 
frees memory on program's exit. Teardown loops through strings if not null and frees memory for each character.
